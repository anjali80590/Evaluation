In the Game model keeping a referene to the Publisher helps avoid repeating same publisheer details in every game record this makes data cleaner , easier to maintain ,and ensures that if publisher changes you only need to update it once for it show it everywhere . It also keeps game document smaller which can improve performace . If we instead stored the full publisher details inside each game any change to publisher would mean updating all games linked to it . This couled led to mistmatch infromation slower udpates .
