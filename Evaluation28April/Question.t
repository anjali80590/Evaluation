Q: 1
You are required to build a Recipe Sharing Web Application that allows users to add new recipes, view existing recipes,
format text properly, filter recipes by category, and store data persistently using LocalStorage.

Your application must include the following:

Structured HTML Layout using semantic elements (<header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>)
 Text Formatting (Bold, Italic, Underline, Subscript, Superscript) inside recipe descriptions



# 1️⃣ Navigation Bar & Header
# Navigation links: Home | Add Recipe | View Recipes
# Header should contain application name and navigation bar


# 2️⃣ Add Recipe Form
# Users should be able to add a new recipe with:
# Recipe Name (Text Input, Required)
# Ingredients (Textarea Input, Required, Ingredients displayed in a Table)
# Category (Dropdown: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert, Drinks)
# Preparation Steps (Textarea Input, Required, Supports Formatting: Bold, Italic, Underline)
# Submit Button



3️⃣ Display Recipes
Recipes should be displayed dynamically.
Each recipe card must include:
Recipe Title & Description (Formatted using Bold, Italic, Underline)
Ingredients (Displayed in a Table)
Category Label


4️⃣ Filter Recipes by Category
Users should be able to filter recipes based on:
Category (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, etc.)


5️⃣ CSS Styling & Layout
Apply CSS Selectors (Universal, Element, Class, ID, Combinators)
Use Box Model (Margin, Padding, Border, Content) for layout
Implement CSS Positioning (Relative, Absolute, Sticky, Fixed)
Use CSS Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements to enhance UI (:hover, :before, :after)
Apply Gradients & Custom Fonts
Make sure design is responsive with Media Queries


6️⃣ JavaScript Functionalities
DOM Manipulation: Capture form input and dynamically display recipes
Filtering: Implement filter by category
Form Validation: Ensure required fields are filled before submission
LocalStorage: Save recipes so they remain after a page refresh
Dark Mode Toggle: Users can switch themes
Outcome
At the end of this project, you will have a functional Recipe Sharing Web App where users can:

Add new recipes

View recipes in a structured format

Filter recipes by category

See properly formatted text (Bold, Italic, Underline, Tables, etc.)

Ensure data persists using LocalStorage

Use responsive design principles
