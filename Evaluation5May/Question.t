Problem Statement:
You are tasked with building a Student Profile Dashboard using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase. The dashboard should allow students to view, edit, and store their profile details dynamically. The data should be persisted in Firebase, enabling real-time updates.

Features and Requirements:
1. HTML Structure & Semantics
Use semantic HTML tags like <header>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, etc.
Include meta tags for SEO and responsiveness.
Implement a navigation bar with links to "Home," "Profile," and "Settings."
Create a student details table using the <table> tag.
2. CSS Styling & Layout
Apply internal, external, and inline styles appropriately.
Implement CSS Selectors (element, class, ID selectors).
Use CSS Flexbox & Grid:
Flexbox to arrange the profile section.
Grid to structure the student details table.
Implement Box Model properties like margin, padding, border, etc.
Implement CSS Positioning (absolute, relative, sticky, etc.).
Implement a Dark Mode Toggle using CSS.
3. Responsive Design
Use Media Queries to make the layout adaptable to different screen sizes.
Convert the navigation bar into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
4. Student Profile Form
Include a form where students can edit their details:
Name (text input)
Age (number input)
Email (email input)
Course (dropdown select)
Gender (radio buttons)
Skills (checkboxes)
Profile Image Upload (file input)
Add a Submit button to update the student details.
5. JavaScript & DOM Manipulation
Use DOM manipulation to display and update student details dynamically.
Implement Event Listeners for form submissions and button clicks.
Implement a Dark Mode Toggle that switches themes dynamically.
6. Firebase Integration
On form submission, store the student profile details in Firebase.
Fetch the stored student data from Firebase and display it dynamically.
Implement a "Load Data" button to retrieve stored student profiles from Firebase.
7. LocalStorage
Before sending data to Firebase, store it in LocalStorage for offline access.
On page load, check LocalStorage for saved details and display them.
8. Sorting & Filtering (LOs Covered: API-Based Sorting & Filtering)
Implement a search bar to filter students by name.
Add a sort button to arrange students alphabetically by name.
Deliverables:
A fully functional Student Profile Dashboard.
Proper HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation.
Firebase connectivity for data persistence.
LocalStorage support for offline access.
