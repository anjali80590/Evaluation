# // Add student scores privately using closures.
# // Retrieve the list of students and their scores.
# // Sort the students based on their scores in descending order.
# // Filter students who have scored above a given threshold.
# // Calculate the average score using .reduce()

# // Implement a function called createScoreManager() that stores student data privately.
# // This function should return an object with the following methods:
# // Adds a studentâ€™s score.
# // Retrieves the list of students and their scores.
# // Use modules to separate your createScoreManager logic into a different file (e.g., scoreManager.js) and import it into your main file (e.g., main.js).
# // The system should:

# // Generate an array of student names.
# // Filter students who scored above 60.
# // Calculate the average score.
# // Sort the students in descending order based on scores.
# // Expected Deliverables:
# // Implementation

# // A modular JavaScript structure with:
# // scoreManager.js for the logic
# // main.js for interaction and execution
# // The createScoreManager() function with methods:
# // addScore(name, score)
# // getScores()
# // Proper usage of closures for data privacy.
# // Usage of .reduce() for calculating the average score.
# // Functional Features

# // Sorting student scores in descending order.
# // Filtering students with scores above 60.
# // Displaying the average score.
